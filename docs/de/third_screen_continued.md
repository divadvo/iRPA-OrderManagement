# Continue Defining Third Screen


## Define Line Items

Next we will define the line items of an order. We will define each column as a collection.

### Products

1. Press on the first product cell. Make sure `td` is selected in the tree view. 

2. Name this element, e.g.

```
Products
```
3. Remove the text criteria

4. Select `id` instead

5. Modify the criteria. Id should `contain` `cell0`, meaning the 0th column. 

```
cell0
```

Now all 3 product cells have been identified. We want to define these as a collection.

6. Click on `declare element`.

7. Click on `3 triangles`, to define these elements as a collection

The elements have been detected. `td` is the collection. The elements have been uniquely identified.

### Unit Prices

1. Select the unit price in the first row.

2. Make sure it's the `span` element in the tree, containing multiple elements (`24.34 EUR` instead of just `24.34`)

3. Remove text as criteria

4. Set `class` as criteria instead.

Now we want to make sure that the collection of multiple elements is based on the table cells. For this we will use `td` as the criteria for finding the `span` elements. 

5. Right click on `td` and select `add to criteria`.

`td` is now part of the criteria. 

6. Adjust the `id` of `td` to be `contains` and value:

```
cell1
```

![](../images/0430.png)

7. `Rename` the element to e.g.

```
unitPrices
```

8. Click on `declare element`

Now instead of defining a collection like we did before, we will declare the collection based on the parent element `td` we added as condition. This way the bot will loop over the `td` cells and find the `span` within these.

9. Click on `...` next to `td` and click `set as collection`.

![](../images/0450.png)

The element has been defined.

### Total Prices

The last column is `total prices`. That column has a similar structure as `unit price`, so we will speed up the definition process by copying `unitPrice` element and adjusting the configuration slightly.

1. Click on `...` next to `unitPrices`. 

2. Select `duplicate`


![](../images/0470.png)

3. Name the new element, e.g.

```
totalPrices
```

![](../images/0480.png)


Next, adjust the `id` of the cell from 2nd=`1` to 4th=`3` (counting starts from `0`)

4. Click on `id` under `td`.

![](../images/0490.png)

5. Set criteria to `contains`  and value

```
cell3
```

![](../images/0500.png)

The total prices have been defined. We didn't have to define them from scratch and were able to save time by duplicating another definition.

### Quantities

1. Click on the quantities cell. Make sure the `td` (table cell) element is selected in the tree view.

2. Remove the text criteria. Adjust the criteria to `id`. In the popup choose `contains` and `cell2`.

![](../images/1001.png)

3. Rename the element to `quantities`, make sure the criteria are like in the screenshot.

4. Click on declare and make the element a collection by clicking on the triangles in the declared elements section.

## Save


The screens and elements have been defined. We can now move on to defining the automation.

Don't forget to save your work by clicking `save` in the top right.

Nice! We have completed the capturing of the application and can now start creating the actual automation.
